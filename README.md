## 1 Overview of School District Analysis 

The purpose of the overall school district analysis is to assist Maria in analyzing students' standardized test scores for math and reading as well as supplemental information on the schools they attend. In this portion of the analysis, Maria has been notified of evidence of academic dishonesty - specifically with the math and reading scores for Thomas High School. Grades appear to have been altered, and the challenge was to replace grades for THS and rerun the school district analysis. The insights derived from this analysis should be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. The following sections discuss the results of the school district analysis and a summary highlighting significant changes to the school district analysis after scores were updated.
